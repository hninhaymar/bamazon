As a customer, you can use "node bamazonCustomer.js" to buy products in stock.
product sales get calculated and updated for every successful sale transaction

As a manager, you can use "node bamazonManager.js" to look at the current stock, add inventory to existing products and add new products.
I had purposely made the user enter the "item id" and it checks for existing id and prompts you to enter a new item ID

As a supervisor, you can use "node bamazonSupervisor.js" to look at the inventory from a department level.
You can add a new department and view total sales and profits/losses
